# Assignment Modification:
To enhance the assignment, consider incorporating testing practices, introducing complex scenarios, and implementing a detailed rubric. By emphasizing the creation of unit tests and clear error messages, students can gain a deeper understanding of testing methodologies, ensuring accurate value returns and error handling. Introducing intricate transaction scenarios as a supplementary component to the assignment can provide students with a more comprehensive learning experience. Additionally, a well-defined rubric that evaluates correctness, code quality, and adherence to best practices will guide students towards producing high-quality submissions.

This assignment was an interesting and good reintroduction to programming in Java.
